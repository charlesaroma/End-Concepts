# Project Context Log

## Navbar Implementation (2024-06-09)
- A responsive Navbar was implemented in `src/components/layouts/Navbar.jsx`.
- The Navbar uses a `menuData` array to define menu items and dropdowns, matching the provided UI.
- Dropdowns and mobile menu are supported, with state for open/close and dropdown toggling.
- The logo is loaded from `public/cragroup.svg`.
- Icons are rendered using the `@iconify/react` package (e.g., menu, close, chevron-down).
- Navigation is handled with `react-router-dom`'s `Link` and `NavLink`.

## App Routing
- `src/App.jsx` is updated to use `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`.
- The Navbar is rendered at the top of the app.
- All menu and dropdown paths are routed to placeholder components for now.

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder components with actual page components as needed.
- Style the Navbar further if required.
- Update `menuData` if navigation structure changes.
