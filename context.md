# Project Context Log

## Navbar Implementation (2024-06-09)
- A responsive Navbar was implemented in `src/components/layouts/Navbar.jsx`.
- The Navbar uses a `menuData` array to define menu items and dropdowns, matching the provided UI.
- Dropdowns and mobile menu are supported, with state for open/close and dropdown toggling.
- The logo is loaded from `public/cragroup.svg`.
- Icons are rendered using the `@iconify/react` package (e.g., menu, close, chevron-down).
- Navigation is handled with `react-router-dom`'s `Link` and `NavLink`.

## App Routing
- `src/App.jsx` is updated to use `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`.
- The Navbar is rendered at the top of the app.
- All menu and dropdown paths are routed to placeholder components for now.

## Navbar Improvements (2024-06-09)
- Refactored Navbar for professional responsiveness across all device sizes (mobile, medium, large).
- Added clear comment headings for each major section (logo, desktop menu, mobile menu button, mobile menu, etc) for easier code navigation.
- Improved accessibility with aria attributes for dropdowns and menu buttons.

## Hero Section Update (2024-06-09)
- `src/pages/1.Home/1Hero.jsx` now uses only Tailwind CSS classes for all styling, including background shapes.
- All inline style props have been removed; everything is handled with Tailwind utility classes.

## Color Update (2024-06-09)
- The main blue color (`#001d6c`) and orange (`#e88936`) have been updated in both the Hero and Navbar components using Tailwind's arbitrary color classes for all relevant text and backgrounds.

## Hero Comments Update (2024-06-09)
- Added simple comment headers to `src/pages/1.Home/1hero.jsx` for each major section (imports, component, left text, right image, background shapes, export) for easier code navigation.

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder components with actual page components as needed.
- Style the Navbar further if required.
- Update `menuData` if navigation structure changes.

## Our Solutions Slider (2024-06-09)
- Implemented a horizontally scrollable, looping slider in `src/pages/1.Home/2OurSolutions.jsx`.
- Solutions are defined in a data array (icon + label).
- Uses Tailwind for styling and Iconify for icons.
- Section is imported and rendered in `0home.jsx` below the Hero.
