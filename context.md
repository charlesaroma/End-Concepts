# Project Context Log

## Navbar Implementation (2024-06-09)
- A responsive Navbar was implemented in `src/components/layouts/Navbar.jsx`.
- The Navbar uses a `menuData` array to define menu items and dropdowns, matching the provided UI.
- Dropdowns and mobile menu are supported, with state for open/close and dropdown toggling.
- The logo is loaded from `public/cragroup.svg`.
- Icons are rendered using the `@iconify/react` package (e.g., menu, close, chevron-down).
- Navigation is handled with `react-router-dom`'s `Link` and `NavLink`.

## App Routing
- `src/App.jsx` is updated to use `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom`.
- The Navbar is rendered at the top of the app.
- All menu and dropdown paths are routed to placeholder components for now.

## Navbar Improvements (2024-06-09)
- Refactored Navbar for professional responsiveness across all device sizes (mobile, medium, large).
- Added clear comment headings for each major section (logo, desktop menu, mobile menu button, mobile menu, etc) for easier code navigation.
- Improved accessibility with aria attributes for dropdowns and menu buttons.

## Hero Section Update (2024-06-09)
- `src/pages/1.Home/1Hero.jsx` now uses only Tailwind CSS classes for all styling, including background shapes.
- All inline style props have been removed; everything is handled with Tailwind utility classes.

## Color Update (2024-06-09)
- The main blue color (`#001d6c`) and orange (`#e88936`) have been updated in both the Hero and Navbar components using Tailwind's arbitrary color classes for all relevant text and backgrounds.

## Hero Comments Update (2024-06-09)
- Added simple comment headers to `src/pages/1.Home/1hero.jsx` for each major section (imports, component, left text, right image, background shapes, export) for easier code navigation.

## Next Steps
- Replace placeholder components with actual page components as needed.
- Style the Navbar further if required.
- Update `menuData` if navigation structure changes.

## Our Solutions Slider (2024-06-09)
- Implemented a horizontally scrollable, looping slider in `src/pages/1.Home/2OurSolutions.jsx`.
- Solutions are defined in a data array (icon + label).
- Uses Tailwind for styling and Iconify for icons.
- Section is imported and rendered in `0home.jsx` below the Hero.

## Footer Implementation (2024-06-09)
- The Footer component was implemented in `src/components/layouts/Footer.jsx` to match the provided UI reference.
- Features: dark blue background, logo, Terms of Service and Privacy Policy buttons, columns for Our Expertise and Quick Links, contact info, and a bottom bar with copyright and social icons.
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS.
- Footer is now rendered below the main content in `App.jsx`.

## "Our Numbers" Section (2024-06-09)
- Implemented the "Our Numbers" component in `src/pages/1.Home/4OurNumber.jsx`.
- Features a two-column layout with text on the left and a styled image on the right.
- The section is fully responsive with a minimum height of `80vh`.
- The image uses a custom `clip-path` to create a dynamic, "leaking" shape.

## "Our Numbers" Section Update (2024-06-09)
- Reverted to the original image and updated the `clip-path` style for a more geometric container shape.

## HomeService Section Mobile Responsiveness (2024-06-09)
- Updated `src/pages/1.Home/3HomeService.jsx` to provide a mobile-friendly layout.
- On mobile screens, the section now displays a simple, vertically-stacked layout with all services visible, avoiding scroll-based animation and overflow issues.
- On desktop, the interactive scroll animation is preserved.

## Who We Are Section Start (2024-06-09)
- Began work on the 'Who We Are' section, starting with the About Us page.
- All subpages (Our History, Our Values, Our Partners, etc.) will be imported and rendered in `src/pages/2.WhoWeAre/1AboutUs/0AboutUs.jsx`.
- UI reference for the About Us page will be followed for layout and content.

## About Us Section Navbar (2024-06-09)

## About Us: Fixed Section Navbar (2024-06-09)

- Content spacing is adjusted to prevent overlap with the fixed navbars.
- Navigation remains smooth and user-friendly.

## About Us: Section Navbar Componentization (2024-06-09)
